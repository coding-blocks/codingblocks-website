    "content": "C++ Basic Proficiency Certification is a C++ training course designed to provide you with a platform from where you can start your journey in the amazing world of programming and software. This beginner's course will include programming fundamentals using C++.<br> C++ is known to be a very powerful language. C++ allows you to have a lot of control as to how you use computer resources effectively and efficiently better than other languages. Thanks to C++'s performance, it is often used to develop game engines, games, and desktop apps. As a statically typed language, C++ is generally more performant than dynamically typed languages because the code is type-checked before it is executed. Companies like Google and Facebook, also need C++ developers to optimize their apps or work on their products. <br><br>"
