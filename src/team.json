All our mentors have been well performing students at the best of colleges, have worked at industry giants such as Sony, Cyanogen, SanDisk, Facebook, Barclays, Practo, Harman, DRDO, Cadence, American Express, Nagarro and many more. We also have GSoCers, GSoC Mentors and Google Code-in mentors in our team, in addition to people who've been published in international journals.
