Yes, you're right, it's Unity. Unity is a cross-platform game engine which is primarily used to develop both three-dimensional and two-dimensional video games and simulations for computers, consoles, and mobile devices. Kickstart your Game development journey by rapidly prototyping four different games using the most widely used game engine. Unity development is one of the most in-demand tech skills and has one of the highest forecasted growth rates, at over 35% over the next two years.</p><p class=\"lead\">This course will comprise 10 classes, with over forty hours of course coverage. A select few students from the early bird students will also get a very exclusive preview of VR game development for Android.</p>"
