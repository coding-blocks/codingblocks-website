                    <p class="lead"><strong>Coding Blocks</strong> was founded in 2014 with a mission to create skilled software engineers for our country and the world. We aim to bridge the gap between the quality of skills demanded by industry and the quality of skills imparted by conventional institutes.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Apart from acquiring technological skills, adapting to an industrial environment is of utmost importance. Keeping this in mind, Coding Blocks has introduced a brand new Industrial Training program. This will be a five-six month long program wherein you'll learn some important as well as exciting technologies such as Python development, Web Development, App Development as well as Advanced Java. This will help you gain the skill set required by the industry these days, while working in a startup environment. In the last two months of the program, the top performers will even be eligible for a <strong>stipend of up to â‚¹10,000 per month</strong>.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        The enrollment cum scholarship test was held on <strong>December 21</strong> and we saw a huge turnout for the same. <strong>Scholarships of up to 75% were on offer</strong>, and the mails for the same have already been sent. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity which we think you wouldn't want to miss. So, go ahead and register at the link below for an exciting educational journey through the world of technology. All the best!</p>
