					<p class="lead">
						Coding Blocks is pleased to bring you the ultimate competitive programming study material package for all those who are willing to get their hands on our book, the ultimate guide to all things related to Competitive Coding. Along with the book, you'll also get three exclusive videos on the most important topics of CP: Dynamic Programming, Dynamic Programming with Bitmasks and Backtracking. Our material has been hand crafted to ensure your success in challenges such as Google CodeJam, Google Kickstart, ACM-ICPC, and more.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Though we suggest you join our Competitive Programming online or offline courses,
                        we understand that it is not always possible to devote that amount of time at one stretch.
                        This package will help you foray into the exciting world of competitive coding.
                        You will master commonly used problem solving techniques,
                        hone your mathematical analysis skills, and push the boundaries of your reasoning abilities.
                        This package is for all the coders who are looking forward to optimizing their
                        problem-solving process, and to learning new algorithmic skills which will help
                        them solve problems quickly.
