Starting from the basics (like activity lifecycle :P) we went on to learn Firebase for accessing data from server. We also had special class on Animations and User Interface. As part of the assignments we made apps after every class , which covered all the concepts learned till then. </p>

It will help you clear your basics as a lot of code for the understanding of the concept/algorithm and for the project, is written from scratch. You’ll get to work on various interesting projects like automatic colorization, language modeling, neural art etc. The course covers most of the important topics in this field. The faculty is extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and cooperative.</p>

If you want to have a actual understanding of ml . I will recommend doing the course . You will not regret it

This is not just any basic course like Andrew Ng’s course on Coursera. Firstly it contains all the important topics that are being researched currently in the world. Secondly, each topic is coded from scratch. You will learn to do projects like Classification of Images, Neural art and even music generation. But beware, this course isn’t easy. You will need to invest time in doing your assignments at home, otherwise you would be quite lost.
